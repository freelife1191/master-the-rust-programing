/*
You are required to write a program to sort the (fruit-name, price, quanity) tuples by
ascending order where fruit-name is string, price and quanity are numbers.
1: Sort based on fruit-name;
2: Then sort based on price;
3: Then sort by quantiy.
The priority is that fruit-name > price > quanity.
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:

Mango-us,50,80
Mango-uk,50,80
Orange,19,80
Blackberry,20,90
Blueberry,17,91
Blueberry,17,93
Blueberry,21,85

Expected output:
("Blackberry", 20, 90)
("Blueberry", 17, 91)
("Blueberry", 17, 93)
("Blueberry", 21, 85)
("Mango-uk", 50, 80)
("Mango-us", 50, 80)
("Orange", 19, 80)

Hint :
1) Remember you can compare the tuple lexicographically.
2) Use bubble sort. logic is given in the code.
 You need to compare the ith tuple with the (i+1)th tuple and swap them if necessary
3) Use swap() method for swapping array elements (https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.swap)

    //this loop is for number of passes through the list
    for _ in 0..len {
        //inner loop for the actual comparison and swapping of elements
